// Assignments

// Part 1. VALUES AND VARIABLES
// 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
// assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
// 2. Log their values to the console

const country = "Canada";
const continent = "North America";
let population = 38.25;

// console.log(
//   `I live in ${country}, ${continent} which has a population of ${population} million people.`
// );

// Part 2. DATA TYPES

// LECTURE: Data Types
// 1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
// country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
// 'language', but don't assign it any value yet
// 2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
// to the console

const isIsland = false;
let language;

// console.log(typeof isIsland);
// console.log(typeof population);
// console.log(typeof country);
// console.log(typeof language);

// Part 3. LET, CONST, VAR

// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
//   countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
//   2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
//   change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
//   3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens

language = "english";
// console.log(language);

// Part 4. BASIC OPERATORS

// 1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
// then how many people would live in each half?
// 2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
// 3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
// Finland?
// 4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
// have less people than the average country?
// 5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
// which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
// people speak portuguese'

// console.log("Half of the population of Canada in millions: " + population / 2);
// console.log(population++);

const finlandPopulation = 6;
console.log(
  "Does Canada have more people that Finland? " +
    (population > finlandPopulation)
);

const averagePopulation = 33;

// console.log(
//   "Does Canada have less people than the average country? " +
//     (population < averagePopulation)
// );

// console.log(
//   `${country} is in ${continent} and its ${population} million people mostly speak ${language}.`
// );

// Part 7. IF/ELSE STATEMENTS

// 1. If your country's population is greater that 33 million, log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like
// 'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33
// minus the country's population)
// 2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
// 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original

if (population > averagePopulation) {
  console.log(`${country}'s population is above average`);
} else {
  const populationDifference = averagePopulation - population;
  console.log(
    `${country}'s population is ${populationDifference} million below the average.`
  );
}

// Equality Operators
// 1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
// prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
// have?');
// 2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
// == for now)
// 3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
// is greater than 1
// 4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
// 'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
// 5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
// 6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
// 'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
// is this happening?
// 7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
// when you input 1
// 8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
// situation

const numNeighbours = Number(
  prompt("How many neighbour countries does your country have?")
);

if (numNeighbours === 1) {
  console.log("Only 1 border!");
} else if (numNeighbours > 1) {
  console.log("More than 1 border");
} else {
  console.log("No borders");
}

// Logical Operators
// 1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way
// 2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a
// country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an
// island.
// 3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her.
// You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take
// your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
// 4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If
// not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
// 5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily
// change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in
// Canada :D)

if (language === "english" && population < 50 && !isIsland) {
  console.log(`You should live in ${country}!`);
} else {
  console.log(`${country} does not meet your criteria.`);
}

// The switch Statement
// 1. Use a switch statement to log the following string for the given 'language':
// chinese or mandarin: 'MOST number of native speakers!'
// spanish: '2nd place in number of native speakers'
// english: '3rd place'
// hindi: 'Number 4'
// arabic: '5th most spoken language'
// for all other simply log 'Great language too :D'

switch (language) {
  case "chinese":
  case "mandarin":
    console.log("MOST number of native speakers!");
    break;
  case "spanish":
    console.log("2nd place in number of native speakers");
    break;
  case "english":
    console.log("3rd place");
    break;
  case "hindi":
    console.log("Number 4");
    break;
  case "arabic":
    console.log("5th most spoken language");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Great language too :D");
}

// The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
// 1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator
// to log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'.
// Otherwise, simply log 'Portugal's population is below average'. Notice how only
// one word changes between these two sentences!
// 2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
// 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original

console.log(
  `${country}'s population is ${population > 33 ? "above" : "below"} average.`
);
